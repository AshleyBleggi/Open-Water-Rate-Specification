# Open Water Rate Specification

This repository documents the Open Water Rate Specification (OWRS), a machine-readable format 
for specifying and sharing water rate information. 

OWRS is designed to fully encode a water utility's rate structure and pricing schedules in a form
that is easy to store, share, modify and apply programmatically.
